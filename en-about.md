    <b>"Longing for Karin Lindgren"</b> <br> Knut Karin Lindgren (1949–2011) was a dairy farmer and subject of Swedish film-maker Rebecka Rasmusson’s 2010 documentary short film <i>En bondes längtan</i> (translation: A Farmer’s Desire). Lindgren lived her entire life in the small village of Sankt Olof, located in the southern part of
Sweden. Lindgren realised and came out as trans late in life. When seeking care to receive gender affirming treatment, she was asked to “dress as a woman” for five years to “see how she’d feel.”

   Lindgren was awarded the Federation of Swedish Farmers’ gold medal for 23 years of delivering exceptional quality milk in 2002. Karin: ”<i>It was crown princess Victoria who presented the medal, it’s probably not every day she gets to meet a woman dressed in a skirt with the name Knut.</i>” Lindgren passed away shortly after the premiere of the film and was buried under her birthname.
